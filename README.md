# RTv1

Ray tracer in C

## üöÄ Clone and Run

gcl https://github.com/gouiferda/RTv1.git;
cd RTv1;
make run;

## üìù To do

- [X] Author file
- [X] Minilibx functions: including expose properly (mlx_expose_hook)
- [ ] Functions and structures 
    - [X] vector
    - [X] ray
    - [X] figure
    - [ ] camera
    - [ ] light
    - [ ] material (color , diffuse and specular/shiningness)
- [X] Mapping the coords system (0,0,0) to screen (0,0)
- [ ] Light works on fixed and moved objects - Multi objects and intersections
    - [ ] ambiant light / intersection with ray
        - [X] sphere
        - [X] plane
        - [ ] cylinder
        - [ ] cone
    - [ ] diffusion: lambert diffuse model
    - [ ] specular: blinn specular model
- [ ] Shadows
- [ ] Moving and rotating the objects
- [ ] Moving and rotating the camera
- [ ] Norm & Handle errors and leaks and messages
- [ ] Bonuses: Shine effect, Multi lights (spots)
- [ ] Extra Bonuses: Antialiasing, External files for scene description, Reflection, Transparency, Shadow according to transparency...

## ‚úÖ Steps

1. [X] Scanning the screen
1. [X] casting rays for good
1. [X] The closest intersection
1. [X] Sphere-Ray intersection
1. [X] Plane-Ray intersection
1. [ ] Cylinder-Ray intersection
1. [ ] Cone-Ray intersection
1. [ ] Lighting our intersection point
1. [ ] Lambert
1. [ ] Reflection
1. [ ] Phong
1. [ ] Antialiasing


## üó∫ Key definitions

- Ambiant: Color alone of the object
- Diffuse: controls roghness/dullness of object
- Specular: controls shinningness
- Specular + Diffuse: How surface responds to light
- Indirect illumination: Light bounding off of other objects in the scene (Reflected rays)
- Shading model: diffuse + specular reflection
