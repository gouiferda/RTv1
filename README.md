## Key definitions

- Ambiant: Color alone of the object
- Diffuse: controls roghness/dullness of object
- Specular: controls shinningness
- Specular + Diffuse: How surface responds to light
- Indirect illumination: Light bounding off of other objects in the scene (Reflected rays)
- Shading model: diffuse + specular reflection
