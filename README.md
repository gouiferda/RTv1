## üó∫ Key definitions

- Ambiant: Color alone of the object
- Diffuse: controls roghness/dullness of object
- Specular: controls shinningness (noticable in : metal , marbles)
- Specular + Diffuse: How surface responds to light
- Indirect illumination: Light bounding off of other objects in the scene (Reflected rays)
- Shading model: diffuse + specular reflection


**Lambert: (Diffuse)**

To caluclate the color we need:
1. surface normal (intersection point - center of sphere) normalized
1. direction to the light (light pos - intersection point) normalized
1. do a dot product 
1. refelective color of the sphere

each rgb has from 0 to 1
color = (l.n) x light.intensity x color of figure rgb 
color = (L.N) x M diff x color of figure rgb 
L: Ray towards light direction
N: normal at hit pos,
M diffuse: material's diffuse coeficcient // how much the figure is absorbing light / 1 max 0 min
C object: color of object
Dot product should not be negative


**Blinn-Phong shading model: (Specular shading)**

Phong_term = (V.R)^k

V- Ray towards viewer
R- Light ray reflexted direction
k - Material's specular coefficient (shininess)
(L: intersection to light, N normal, R referse of L : reflection, V intersection to viewer ray to point)
Dot product should not be negative

Half way vector:

H = L + V
H = norm (H)

Blinn term = (H.R)^k

Material: 
- Color:base color
- Ambient: what color it reflects in ambient light
- Diffuse: what color it reflect in diffuse light
- Specular: what is the color of its specular hihglight
