Project Status
---------------
We're currently hard at work on the v3.0.0 release. This will be a large evolution of the entire
project: all three books, new and revised content, buildable with CMake, with a good number of code
refactoring improvements. We're hoping to release this next version in January or February of 2020.

If you'd like a sneak peek, we're over in the `development` branch. See the instructions below if
you'd like to contribute!
