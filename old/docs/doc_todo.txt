TODO list

Overall from correction doc:
    -Get your shit well
    -Author file
    -expose property (mlx_expose_hook)
    -Les 4 objects de base: sphere plane cylinder cone
    -Multi objects and intersections
    -Moving and rotating the objects
    -Moving and rotating the camera
    -Light works on fixed and moved objects
    -Shadows
    -Bonuses: Shine effect,Multi light

Done:
    -Create project files & upgrade mlx  [DONE]
    -Read subject at  [ON IT]
        part1: https://www.purplealienplanet.com/node/20  [DONE KINDA] 50%
            - details of intersection calculation
        part2: https://www.purplealienplanet.com/node/23  [ON IT KINDA] 50%
            - pixel and bits stuff
            - structures
            - Lambertian reflectance
            - Diffuse reflection
            - the way:
                for(HEIGHT){
                    for(WIDTH){
                        do for every ray:
                            - Find closest ray/sphere intersection:
                            * Iterate over every sphere

                            - For each lightsource that can be reached:
                                * Calculate Lambert dot product with material reflection
                                * Calculate each colour component, consisting of:
                                    - Lambert dot product result
                                    - Per colour intensity of the incoming light

                            - Either go with reflected ray or go to next pixel
                    }
                }
